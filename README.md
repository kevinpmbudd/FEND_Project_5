Neighborhood Map Project

With a Google Map as the medium, you can explore the world of coffee, focusing on coffeshops in and around Los Angeles, Ca.

To run the application simply launch build/index.html in your browser of choice from
the device of your choice. You may search the featured coffeeshops by name by use of
the search box located at the top of the app. Searching by name will filter the locations
presented in the listview and the markers displayed on the map. Clicking on an item in the
list will activate a pop up info window associated with that location. Thanks to the the
Yelp community a rating of that location and the number of times it has been rated will
be displayed in the infowindow. Enjoy.
